# GameCounter2.0
This is the result of me deciding to rebuild [my old score keeping app](https://github.com/jesperlndqvst/game-counter) in order to practice my skills in React. Use it for all types of games that need score keeping. 

## How to use it
1. Clone this repo in GitHub Desktop, in your terminal or go to: https://game-counter.netlify.app/
2. Start counting!

## Features
- Keep it on your home screen by downloading it as PWA. Available on [Progressive App Store](https://progressiveapp.store/pwa/GameCounter).
- Automatically switches to dark mode when it gets dark.
- No installation is required and the points are saved in local storage in the event of an interruption.
